## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a project to prove our skills on SQL based backend.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
**We created  this project with every dependency in a docker container.**

To run our app you have two options:
Either run docker compose containers with this command.

```
docker-compose up 
```
After this,you get into the container and install every dependency described below this text.

```
docker exec -it <containerID> bash
```
```
npm install sequelize-cli -g
```
```
npm install
```

The second option is to install every dependency in local and for that you have to do the same proces but skipping the `docker-compose` part.


After installing every dependency, you can get a command list using

```
sequelize
```
Inside of this list you have to run the next three.
```
sequelize db:create
```
```
sequelize db:migrate
```
```
sequelize db:seed:all
```
To test our app, you hace a postman collection in this link.
